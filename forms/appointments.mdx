Dynamic Forms let AI agents collect **structured data** from contacts while they are on a call. The system allows you to create custom forms with specific fields, assign those forms to your agents, and have the AI automatically ask the right questions during conversations. All submissions are stored and available in a dedicated submissions dashboard, where you can review, filter, and export data for easier management and analysis.

Use Cases: Dynamic Forms are ideal for lead qualification surveys, customer feedback collection, appointment scheduling details, product preference gathering, contact information updates, or any other situation where you need consistent, structured data from AI-powered conversations. Forms can include different field types (such as text, numbers, choices, and dates) so you can capture the exact data format required for each workflow.
