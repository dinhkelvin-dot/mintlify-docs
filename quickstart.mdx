<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rent Phone Number" icon="phone">
    1. Navigate to your \*\*Phone Numbers \*\*section.
    2. Click **Rent Phone Number and Purchase.**

    ##### **How Phone Number Management Works**

    The Phone Numbers section allows you to rent and manage dedicated phone numbers for your AI calling agents. Each number costs 30 credits per month and can be used for both inbound and outbound calls. Search for numbers by area code, postal code, or city/region to find the perfect local presence for your business.

    **Note:** Numbers are billed monthly and charged automatically. You can connect each phone number to specific AI agents through the "Manage Connections" feature. Track your active numbers, connection status, and monthly credit usage directly from the dashboard.
  </Accordion>

### Step 3: Connect your agents

<Accordion title="Agent Type Selection" icon="user-robot">
  Choose between Incoming Agent (open-ended AI conversations) or Flow Agent (deterministic flow-based execution). If you havent created yet, please go and create your 1st agent.
