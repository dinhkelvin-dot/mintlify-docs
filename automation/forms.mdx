The **Appointments System** lets your AI agent schedule meetings with contacts while it is on a live call. You can set scheduling rules such as buffer time between appointments, the maximum number of appointments per day, and your working hours. To control when bookings are allowed, select your working days and define the start and end times for each day. The calendar view shows all upcoming and past appointments, and you can switch between day, week, or month views to easily scan your schedule.

Key Features: The **Appointments System** lets you enable overlapping appointments for high-volume or busy schedules while still keeping control over your calendar. It allows you to set buffer times between meetings to avoid back-to-back bookings, limit the number of appointments per day to manage workload, and define custom working hours for each day of the week. The system automatically checks for conflicts, respects your availability settings, and ensures AI agents can only book appointments on your behalf within the rules you have configured.
